## Piscine_Preparation


In preparation for the piscine program, I aimed to familiarize myself with the loops and conditional statements commonly used in C.
Coming from a background in C#, this served as a way to adapt to C syntax and its inherent complexity as a primary programming language.


Here's a list of C programming projects I've worked on to prepare for the piscine:

- [DoWhile.c](https://github.com/Arturg04/42/blob/main/Piscine_Preparation/DoWhile.c)
- [EnumBool.c](https://github.com/Arturg04/42/blob/main/Piscine_Preparation/EnumBool.c)
- [For.c](https://github.com/Arturg04/42/blob/main/Piscine_Preparation/For.c)
- [Functions.c](https://github.com/Arturg04/42/blob/main/Piscine_Preparation/Functions.c)
- [HelloWorld.c](https://github.com/Arturg04/42/blob/main/Piscine_Preparation/HelloWorld.c)
- [If.c](https://github.com/Arturg04/42/blob/main/Piscine_Preparation/If.c)
- [maior2V.c](https://github.com/Arturg04/42/blob/main/Piscine_Preparation/maior2V.c)
- [maior3V.c](https://github.com/Arturg04/42/blob/main/Piscine_Preparation/maior3V.c)
- [Média.c](https://github.com/Arturg04/42/blob/main/Piscine_Preparation/media.c)
- [multiplicar2V.c](https://github.com/Arturg04/42/blob/main/Piscine_Preparation/multiplicar2V.c)
- [Switch.c](https://github.com/Arturg04/42/blob/main/Piscine_Preparation/Switch.c)
- [While.c](https://github.com/Arturg04/42/blob/main/Piscine_Preparation/While.c)

### LeetCode

### Libft

The first project at 42 programming school is called libft, and it consists of creating a C library with all the base functions that students will use in future projects.
The goal is to learn how the standard functions of C programming work by coding them from scratch and creating our very own library.

-Functions:

- [ft_bzero.c](https://github.com/Arturg04/42/tree/main/Student_Preparation/Libft/ft_bzero.c)

ft_bzero is a C function that sets a block of memory to zero.
```
void	ft_bzero(void *restrict src, unsigned int n);
```


- [ft_memccpy.c](https://github.com/Arturg04/42/tree/main/Student_Preparation/Libft/ft_memccpy.c)

ft_memccpy is a C function that is used to copy memory from one location to another until a specified character is encountered.
```
void	*ft_memccpy(void *restrict dest, const void *restrict src, int c, unsigned int n);
```


- [ft_memcpy.c](https://github.com/Arturg04/42/tree/main/Student_Preparation/Libft/ft_memcpy.c)

ft_memcpy is a C function that is used to copy memory from one location to another.
```
void	*ft_memcpy(void *restrict dest, void const *restrict src, unsigned int n);
```


- [ft_memmove.c](https://github.com/Arturg04/42/tree/main/Student_Preparation/Libft/ft_memmove.c)

ft_memmove is a C function that is used to copy memory from one location to another but in a safer way because take in count the overlap.
```
void *ft_memmove(void *restrict dest, const void *restrict src, unsigned int n);
```


- [ft_memset.c](https://github.com/Arturg04/42/tree/main/Student_Preparation/Libft/ft_memset.c)

ft_memset is a C function that is used set block of memory to a specific values.
```
void *ft_memmove(void *restrict dest, const void *restrict src, unsigned int n);
```
